# discord-parser

This was created in August 2023. It was used to search through a JSON file at a directory, then make a list of names that appear in messages found in a channel.
If you want to use this parser, you will need a JSON file of your Discord channel, then you will need to insert it in the same directory as the parser.py file. 
Then, you will need to rename the filename variable to your file.
